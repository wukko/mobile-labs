## What's in this directory?
`/ios/EffectiveLabTwo` directory includes full source code and project for this iOS app.  

Clone the repo and open "`/ios/EffectiveLabTwo`" folder in Xcode to build the project or check out the source code.

## What can this app do?
Not much. It can show you native UI with pressable buttons in either English or Russian, that's about it.
